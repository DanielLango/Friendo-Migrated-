# Calendar and Email Functionality Setup Guide

This guide explains what you need to know to enable calendar file downloads and email sending in the Friendo app.

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ What's Already Working
- **Calendar Integration**: The app can add events to the device's native calendar using `expo-calendar`
- **ICS File Generation**: The app generates downloadable .ics calendar files for Outlook/Google Calendar import
- **Email Composition**: The app uses `expo-mail-composer` to open the device's native email app with pre-filled content

### üìã Calendar Functionality

#### Device Calendar Integration
- **Library**: `expo-calendar` (already installed)
- **Functionality**: Adds events directly to the user's device calendar
- **Permissions**: Automatically requests calendar permissions when needed
- **Platforms**: Works on iOS and Android

#### ICS File Download
- **Library**: `expo-file-system` (already installed)
- **Functionality**: Creates downloadable .ics files for calendar import
- **File Location**: Downloads to device's Downloads folder
- **Compatibility**: Works with Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple Calendar, and most calendar apps

### üìß Email Functionality

#### Current Implementation
- **Library**: `expo-mail-composer` (already installed)
- **Functionality**: Opens device's native email app with pre-filled invitation
- **Content**: Includes meeting details, date, time, and venue information
- **Limitations**: Requires user to have a configured email app on their device

#### What Happens When User Sends Email
1. App opens native email client (Mail, Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
2. Email is pre-filled with:
   - Recipient (friend's email)
   - Subject line
   - Meeting details in body
   - Calendar attachment (if selected)
3. User reviews and sends the email manually

### üîß Technical Requirements

#### For Calendar Downloads to Work
- **No additional setup required** - works out of the box
- Files are saved to device's Downloads folder
- Users can import .ics files into any calendar app

#### For Email Sending to Work
- **Device Requirements**:
  - User must have at least one email app installed and configured
  - Common apps: Mail (iOS), Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo Mail, etc.
- **No server setup required** - uses device's native email capabilities

### üöÄ Production Considerations

#### App Store Deployment
- **Permissions**: App will request calendar permissions when needed
- **Email**: No special permissions required (uses device's email apps)
- **File System**: Downloads work automatically on both iOS and Android

#### User Experience
- **Calendar**: Events appear immediately in user's calendar
- **Email**: Opens familiar email app interface
- **Files**: .ics files can be shared or imported into any calendar

### üîç Troubleshooting

#### Calendar Issues
- **Permission Denied**: App will prompt user to grant calendar access
- **Event Not Appearing**: Check if user granted permissions

#### Email Issues
- **No Email App**: User will see system message to install an email app
- **Email Not Sending**: User needs to manually send from their email app

#### File Download Issues
- **File Not Found**: Check device's Downloads folder
- **Import Failed**: Ensure .ics file is valid (app generates standard format)

### üì± Testing

#### How to Test Calendar Integration
1. Schedule a meeting in the app
2. Select "Add to Calendar" options
3. Check device calendar for new event
4. Verify .ics file in Downloads folder

#### How to Test Email Functionality
1. Schedule a meeting with email invitation
2. Enter friend's email address
3. Verify email app opens with pre-filled content
4. Send test email to yourself

### üîÆ Future Enhancements

#### Potential Improvements
- **Direct Email Sending**: Integrate with email service (SendGrid, Mailgun)
- **Calendar Sync**: Two-way sync with external calendars
- **Push Notifications**: Remind users of upcoming meetings
- **RSVP Tracking**: Track friend responses to invitations

#### Current Limitations
- Email requires manual sending by user
- No automatic email delivery
- No read receipts or RSVP tracking
- Calendar events are one-way (no sync back to app)

## Summary

The calendar and email functionality is **ready to use** in production with no additional setup required. The app leverages native device capabilities for maximum compatibility and user familiarity.
